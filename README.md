# Gloomhaven Deck Manager

A flutter app to help players manager their deck during a gloomhaven scenario.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have flutter downloaded and use flutter run to start up the app on chrome, a web server, an ios simulator, an android simulator, or a physical device.

## Explanation

Gloomhaven is a progressive boardgame that evolves over the course of many 'scenarios.' It took me and my friends a while to figure out why we were running out of cards so fast on our first few scenarios. The key is to realize that your health bar is not actually your physical health dial that you keep track of but instead the number of cards you have left in your active deck. Since the only way to truly become exhausted (die) during a scenario is by running out of cards to play. This app is meant to help players make smart decisions with the cards they use at certain times by explaining how many total turns those cards would cost. Since in Gloomhaven some cards can only be played once while others are refreshed after a rest, there is a pretty simple formula for determining how many turns each card played will cost.

## Goals

I have a generic page done that can be modified to fit any deck size, but I would like to create pages for each individual character in gloomhaven since each character deck has its own special gimmicks. For example the Spellweaver can regain all its lost cards and the Mind Thief can use some cards as augments temporarily.

## Collaboration

I think this app could be pretty cool and helpful to new players especially (it already helped me dealing with Jekserah) but I can only get to know one character at a time unless I spoil the game for myself. I would love some help and welcome any pull requests.
